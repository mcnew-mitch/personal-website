    <h2>Diving Deeper into my summer</h2>


    <p>Over the summer I was determined to learn as many new things as I could. Two things in particular were golf and tennis.
        As I am getting older I figured I need to start learning sports that require less physical strain on my body. Golf is 
        largely considered the best sport for this. I began going to the driving range around 4 times a week this summer and eventually
        got good enought to go out on the course. Now my driver is still not great, but my short game is pretty decent. I also began
        playing tennis a lot. My coworker played tennis in high school and gave me a lesson after we were watching the wimbledon during our shift.
        My goal was to get good enough to play casually with friends and family, and I have definitely accomplished this. I recruited one of
        my good friends to learn with me and we improved together over the summer. We are now able to rally consistently and play full sets.

    <h3>Tips I suggest for golf and tennis</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Golf: focus on accuracy over power. Power will come over time.</li>
        <li>Tennis: consistency in your stance and footwork is key. Power is generated from your lower body up.</li>
        <li>Both: Practice makes perfect. You will get better over time if you practice consistently.</li>
    </ul>

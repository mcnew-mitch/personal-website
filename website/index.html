        <h3>About me: Mitchell McNew</h3>

        <p>I am a second year Data Science student at Northeastern University with a minor in mathematics. I have a specific interest in
            data analsis and machine learning. In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, playing basketball, playing tennis, and hanging out with friends.
            As an overall life goal, I want to grow my knowledge in every aspect of my life and become a well rounded individual with lots of experience. 
            I chose to major in Data Science because it allows me to work in all sorts of different industries and explore different aspects of the world and their 
            utilizations of data. In high school, I was on the football, basketball and wrestling teams. I also was part of the schools computer programming club. 
            I have a cat named Perry and want a husky and a turtle when I am older.
